<h1>OscarFlow</h1>
<p>OscarFlow is a simple command language for running various modules over documents. It consists
of a simple series of commands, some of which may take parameters, that perform various
operations on the document being processed. There is no scope for flow control or conditional
execution of statements - it is simply intended as a specification of what you do and
don't want in your processing pipeline.</p>
<p>In most cases, the oscarFlow commands to be run are stored in the <tt>oscarFlow</tt> parameter
in the <a href="properties.html">properties file</a>. In some modes of running, the <tt>data</tt>
command will be added to the front of the flow - for example, in the modes that produce
files in your workspace. In others, the <tt>inline</tt> command, if present, will be deleted.
<h2>Information kept during processing</h2>
<p>During processing, there are three major - and one minor - documents stored in memory.
These are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Source XML</dt>
<dd>The source SciXML. This is kept unchanged during processing.</dd>
<dt>Inline XML</dt>
<dd>A modified version of the source XML. This starts of as a copy of the source XML, and may be 
modified in a number of ways during processing. This includes adding extra elements, adding extra
attributes to existing elements, breaking up text to wrap up parts of it inside new elements,
but is not limited to these - there is even the option to transform the XML using 
XSL stylesheets.</dd>
<dt>Inline Data XML</dt>
<dd>Inline XML, containing annotations produced by the <a href="dataparser.html">Data Parser</a>.</dd>
<dt>SAF XML</dt>
<dd>The standoff annotation - a list of spans of text found in the source XML, with XPoints for
the start and end of these spans. This does not exist at the start of processing, but
may be created at various points.</dd>
<dt>GENIA SAF XML</dt>
<dd>An optional minor part of the process, which is not created by default. This is a standoff
containing information generated using the GENIA tagger. Like the SAF XML, this does not exist
 at the start of processing, but
may be created using various modules.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>A simple flow</h2>
<p>A simple flow for standard Oscar3 parsing would go like this:</p>
<blockquote><tt>recognise data resolve numbersaf inline</tt></blockquote>
<p>This flow would perform the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>recognise: This examines the source XML for named entities, and creates the SAF XML that
describes the named entities.</li>
<li>data: This examines the source XML for experimental data, and produces the inline data
XML.</li>
<li>resolve: This examines each named entity in the SAF XML, and attempts to add chemical structures
and/or ontology IDs to the entities. The inline XML is left unchanged.</li>
<li>numbersaf: This ensures that each element in the SAF XML has its own unique ID.</li>
<li>inline: This looks at each named entity in the SAF XML, and attempts to create a corresponding
element in the inline XML that encloses the span of text of the named entity.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Flow commands</h2>
<p>A flow consists of a space-separated list of commands. For some of these
commands, parameters may be supplied in brackets, in principle as a comma-separated list (there
are currently no commands that only take one parameter. OscarFlow is case insensitive.</p>
<p>The commands are listed in - roughly - the order in which you'd want to run them. A
few additional experimental commands exist which are not documented here, and will
be documented when the functionality that they enable is stable and of acceptable quality.</p>
<dl>
<dt>recognise</dt>
<dd>This examines the source XML for named entities, and creates the SAF XML that
describes the named entities.</dd>
<dt>discardindata</dt>
<dd>This removes named entities from the SAF XML that appear to be inside
expermental data sections (for example assignments of NMR peaks)</dd>
<dt>data</dt>
<dd>This examines the source XML for experimental data, and produces the inline data
XML.</dd>
<dt>resolve</dt>
<dd>This examines each named entity in the SAF XML, and attempts to add chemical structures
and/or ontology IDs to the entities.</dd>
<dt>subtypes</dt>
<dd>This examines each named entity in the SAF XML, and assigns a <a href="subtypes.html">subtype</a> to it.</dd>
<dt>inline</dt>
<dd>This looks at each named entity in the SAF XML, and attempts to create a corresponding
element in the inline XML that encloses the span of text of the named entity.</dd>
<dt>genia</dt>
<dd>This runs the Genia tagger (if configured) over the source XML, and generates the GENIA SAF XML.
This (and the commands that use the Genia XML) is still experimental.</dd>
<dt>tidyelements</dt>
<dd>Using the Genia XML, and a few heuristics, this attempts to remove potential element that have been 
mis-annotated as named entities (things like In, As, Be, I etc. that may be element symbols or English
words) from the SAF XML. (This is now obsolete)</dd>
<dt>adjusttopos</dt>
<dd>Using the Genia XML, this looks at words ending in -ate or -ates, finds those that are verbs
and changes their type from CM to RN.</dd>
<dt>importne</dt>
<dd>This looks at the Genia XML, and transforms the biological named entities that the tagger has
found into the SAF XML.</dd>
<dt>structuretypes</dt>
<dd>This looks at the named entities of type CM in the SAF XML, and (where possible) attempts
to assign these as specific compounds, generic compounds or fragments of compounds.</dd>
<dt>sciborgpp</dt>
<dd>Post-Processing for the SciBorg project. This adds possible POS tags to each named entity
in the SAF XML based on morphology. In addition, for words ending in -ate or -ates previously
marked up as CM, this produces an additional SAF entry where they are RN.</dd>
<dt>numbersaf</dt>
<dd>This assigns unique identifiers to each named entity in the SAF XML. This is only relevant
if you are intending to directly use the SAF XML, and irrelevant if you are going to <tt>inline</tt>
and then discard the SAF XML.</dd>
<dt>xsl</dt>
<dd>This operates upon the inline XML. This is best run after <tt>inline</tt> (in fact, running this
before <tt>inline</tt> may cause <tt>inline</tt> to fail or produce strange output. It takes one
argument: the filename of a stylesheet, stored in uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.misc.resources. An
example stylesheet is provided: <tt>exampletransform.xsl</tt>: this removes the annotation
of named entities of type ONT from the inline XML.</dd>
<dt>dataxsl</dt>
<dd>As <tt>xsl</tt>, but operating on the data XML, not the inline XML.</dd>
