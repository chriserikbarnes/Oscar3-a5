<h1>Pattern-based Named Entity Recognition</h1>
<p>Named entity recognition by pattern matching is a complex
process that occurs in several stages, as part of
a <a href="namerec.html">larger process</a>. It is used to recognise all
named entities when the MEMM is not in use, or just entities of types ONT,
CUST and CPR when the MEMM is in use. In overview, the following
steps are performed in pattern-based name recognition:
<ol>
<li>Generation of token representations</li>
<li>Recognition of potential entities</li>
<li>Sharing of ontology and custom type identifiers</li>
<li>Removal of conflicts between entities</li>
</ol>
<h2>Generation of token representations</h2>
<p>For each token, one or more representations are generated. There are
many possible representations - see the source code of 
uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.recogniser.Token for full details. A cut-down set
of representations are used when the MEMM is being used.
Key representations
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The token, unmodified (also in the cut-down set of representations)</li>
<li>The token, case-normalised  (also in the cut-down set of representations)</li>
<li>If the <a href="ngram.html">n-gram based token classifier</a> classifies
the token as chemical, some representations, as detailed in the
<a href="ngram.html#reps">n-gram classifier help file</a></li>
<li>Which <a href="tlr.html">token-level regexes</a> the token matches, if any.
Note that any cases of <tt>$PN</tt> will
be checked against the <tt>pnStops</tt> in the model file you are using,
and removed if found there. They will also be discarded if, when they
are converted to lowercase (and ONLY when they are converted
to lowercase), they appear in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/usrDictWords.txt</tt></li>
<li><tt>${[A-Z]}</tt> - anything matching the regex <tt>[A-Z]</tt>. Other
representations can also be formed in this way. Note that these regexes
match a whole single token, and as such should not contain whitespace.
These regexes also work in the cut-down set of representations.</li>
<li><tt>$COMPREF</tt> - if the token is a compound ref (i.e. in the SciXML,
represented as <tt>&lt;XREF TYPE="COMPOUND"&gt;</tt>)</li>
<li><tt>$MODIFIEDCOMPREF</tt> - if the token contains a compound ref</li>
<li><tt>$HYPH</tt> - any hyphen/dash  (also in the cut-down set of representations)</li>
<li><tt>$DOTS</tt> - the character "<tt>&#x22ef;</tt>"  (also in the cut-down set of representations)</li>
<li><tt>$CPR</tt> - if the whole token (with a trailing hyphen) matches a
CPR-detecting regex</li>
<li><tt>$CPR_FORMULA</tt> - if the first part of the token matches the 
CPR-detecting regex, and the rest of the formula matches the formula-matching
token-level regex in the <a href="rparser.html">RParser</a> module.</li>
<li><tt>$CPR_COMPREF</tt> - a token that starts with a CPR, and contains
a compound ref in it.</li>
<li><tt>$EM</tt> - if the (case-normalised) token is in an element name or
symbol, as defined in
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/elements.txt</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>$ENDSINEM</tt> - if the token ends in the name of a chemical element,
eg. "dicopper" or "tributyltin"</li>
<li><tt>$BIOOLIGO</tt> - if the bio-oligomer recognising module 
(uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.recogniser.BiooliogomerScorer) scores the token
as a small bio-oligomer (like a tripeptide or disaccharide)</li>
<li><tt>$INCND</tt> - if the token occurs in the ChemNameDict as a whole
chemical name.</li>
<li><tt>$ONTWORD</tt> - if the token occurs as a single-word term in
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/ontology.txt</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>$CMNONWORD</tt> - if the token has no two consecutive lowercase letters,
has an uppercase letter, and either a) the <tt>useWordShapeHeuristic</tt>
option has been set in the properties file, or b) the token appears in
the <tt>chemicalNonWords</tt> section of the extracted training data.</li>
<li><tt>$STOP</tt> - if the token appears in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/closedClass.txt</tt>, 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/stopwords.txt</tt>, in the 
ChemNameDict as a stopword, in the <tt>nonChemicalWords</tt> or 
<tt>nonChemicalNonWords</tt> wordsets in the extracted training data, and if
it does <i>not</i> occur in a list of chemical element names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, <tt>$^</tt> is used as a representation for the start
of the sentence.</p>
<h2>Recognition of potential entities</h2>
<p>This process uses the <a href="dfas.html">name recognition DFAs</a> 
to find potential named entities.
Essentially, the DFAs take the patterns defined in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/ontology.txt</tt>, 
<tt>custEnt.txt</tt> and <tt>neTerms.txt</tt> (the latter only
if the MEMM is not being used), and detect sequences of tokens 
whose representations match
the patterns therein. If the sequence was in <tt>neTerms.txt</tt>, then the
sequence is given the type defined in that file, whereas patterns found in
<tt>ontology.txt</tt> result in the type of ONT and those in
<tt>custEnt.txt</tt> result in the type CUST. Also, if the pattern was
in <tt>ontology.txt</tt>, then the entity is given the appropriate ontology 
identifier - similarly, patterns found in CUST will be given the appropriate 
custom type identifier.</p>
<p>While this is occurring, each token is examined to see if a CPR entity can
be split off the front. If it can (and the rest of the token isn't found in
the <tt>notForPrefix</tt> wordset from the model file), then a
CPR is added as a potential entity. Note that at this point it is possible
to recognise potential entities of the type AHA ("ad-hoc abbreviation", used
for acronym/initialism recognition) and of the type STOP, which
do not appear (or appear as such) in the final markup.</p>
<h2>Sharing of ontology and custom identifiers</h2>
<p>If, at this stage, two potential entities have identical start points and
identical end points, ontology identifiers for those entities are shared, such
that each entity is left with the union of the ontology identifiers for all
of the entities with those start and end points. Custom type identifiers
are shared in a similar process.</p>
<h2>Removal of conflicts between entities</h2>
<p>This process itself contains several stages. Firstly, a backup is make
of all named entities of the types ONT, CPR and CUST. Secondly, the potential named 
entities are filtered, by detecting conflicts (places where named entities are
wholly or partially overlapping), and resolving them by discarding the entity
with the rightmost start point, or if that does not exist, the shortest entity,
or if they are both the same length, the entity whose type has the lowest
priority (STOP > CPR > CJ > RN > CM > ASE > AHA > CUST > ONT). Furthermore, if the 
<tt>deprioritiseONT</tt> option is used, <i>all</i> conflicts between ONTs and 
non-ONTs are resolved in favour of the non-ONT. Next, a dictionary of 
acronym-to-type mappings are made, by finding AHAs that occur inside brackets
with a plausible non-ASE named entity to the left of them 
(eg. "trinitrotoluene (TNT)"), and taking a note of the acronym and the type
of the named entity. Each AHA in turn is then scrutinised; if there is a type
for that acronym, then the AHA is converted to that type, otherwise it is
discarded. All of the entities of type STOP are also discarded at this point.
Finally, the backed-up entities of type ONT, CPR and CUST are added back to the set
of potential NEs, and another round of conflict resolution (as above) is done,
to generate the final list of NEs, from which a SAF file is compiled.</p>
