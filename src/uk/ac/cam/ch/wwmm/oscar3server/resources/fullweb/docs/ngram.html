<h1>n-gram based word classification</h1>
<p>This file details how Oscar3 can guess whether unknown words are chemical
or not. Note that these mechanisms only apply to "words" with two adjacent
lowercase characters. Also note that these mechanisms work on single tokens.
This classifier contributes to name recognition by both the 
<a href="pattern.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="memm.html">MEMM</a>
systems.</p>
<h2>Converting words to 4-grams</h2>
<p>The string to classify is converted to lowercase. Digits are converted to 
<tt>0</tt>, and strings of multiple <tt>0</tt>s are converted to single 
<tt>0</tt>s. A few other conversions are done on hyphens/dashes, quotes/primes
and curly/square brackets. Finally, any character not in a standard alphabet of
52 (letters, <tt>0</tt>, some special
characters) is converted to <tt>S</tt>. The string is padded with 
<tt>^^^</tt> on the left and <tt>$</tt> on the right, and then split into
4-letter fragments.</p>
<p>For example: <tt>13-(&beta;-D-glucosyloxy)docosanoate 
-> ^^^0-(S-d-glucosyloxy)docosanoate$
-> ^^^0 ^^0- ^0-( 0-(S -(S- (S-d S-d- -d-g d-gl -glu gluc luco ucos cosy osyl
sylo ylox loxy oxy) xy)d y)do )doc doco ocos cosa osan sano anoa noat oate ate$
</tt></p>
<h2>Training the classifier</h2>
<p>Two wordlists are compiled: one of chemical words, one of nonchemical words.
These are done by taking entries from the following sources (if necessary,
tokenising them), and adding them to the wordlists. Tokens without two
consecutive lowercase letters are discarded.</p>
<p>The following are added to the chemical wordlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chemical names from ChemNameDict</li>
<li>The <tt>chemicalWords</tt> from the model file</li>
<li>The list of elements in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/elements.txt</tt></li>
<li>The words in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/chemAses.txt</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>The following are added to the nonchemical wordlist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stopwords in ChemNameDict</li>
<li>The stopwords in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/stopwords.txt</tt></li>
<li>The words in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/nonChemAses.txt</tt></li>
<li>The <tt>nonChemicalWords</tt> in the extracted training data</li>
<li>The words in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/usrDictWords.txt</tt> <i>except</i>
those that appear as chemical names in ChemNameDict, or in the 
<tt>chemicalWords</tt> part of the extracted training data.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these lists, we tabulate the frequencies of the various 4-grams in
chemical and nonchemical words. These frequencies are then used to calculate
the probability of the <i>final character</i> of the 4-gram given the previous
three. Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen & Goodman, 1999) is applied so that 
the probabilities are realistic even for rare or unseen 4-grams.</p>
<h2>Applying the classifier</h2>
<p><b>NB</b> From here on in, this only applies to name recognition with
the pattern matching system. The MEMM uses the information differently.</p>
<p>The classifier is only applied to a subset of the token encountered. Firstly,
the token must have two lowercase characters in to qualify. Secondly, the
following tests are applied, in order (such that tokens that are classified
by an earlier test aren't subjected to later tests), to see if the token can be 
automatically classified:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tokens starting with a CPR (such as 1,2-), followed by a word in one of 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/closedClass.txt</tt>,
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/stopwords.txt</tt>,
the ChemNameDict stopwords, or the <tt>nonChemicalWords</tt> or the
<tt>nonChemicalNonWords</tt> parts of the extracted training data, are
automatically classified as nonchemical</li>
<li>Tokens in the <tt>nonChemicalWords</tt> of the extracted training data
are automatically classified as nonchemical</li>
<li>Tokens in the ChemNameDict as a one-token chemical name, or in the
<tt>chemicalWords</tt> part of the extracted training data are automatically
classified as chemical</li>
<li>Tokens in <tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/usrDictWords.txt</tt>
are automatically classified as nonchemical</li>
</ol>
<p>If no automatic classification is made, then the word is classified using
4-grams, by dividing the word up into 4-grams as above. We then calculate
the conditional probabilities of observing the word, given that it is or isn't
a chemical, by calculating the cumulative probabilities of each letter in turn.
These two word-probabilities are reported as (natural) log probabilities, and
the probability of observing the word given that it is a nonchemical word is
subtracted from the probability of observing the word, given that it is a
chemical word, to give a score. The higher the score, the more likely the
word is to be chemical. This score is compared to a threshold 
(<tt>nGramThreshold</tt> in the properties file), and if it is higher that the
threshold, the word is classified as chemical, otherwise it is classified as
nonchemical.</p>  
<h2><a name="reps">After classification as a chemical</a></h2>
<p>Once tokens are classified as chemical, one or more token representations
may be generated. Full details are in the 
uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.recogniser.Token source. The representations are:
<ul>
<li>One of <tt>$CM</tt>, <tt>$CMS</tt> (plural CM), <tt>$RN</tt>, <tt>$CJ</tt>, 
<tt>$ASE</tt>, <tt>$ASES</tt> (plural ASE), <tt>$GP</tt> ("group") - 
see the getTypeForSuffix method for full details.</li>
<li><tt>$-ene</tt>, if the token ends in "ene", and the same for other
suffixes</li>
<li><tt>$-CM</tt> for tokens of type CM (as in the classification above)
that start with a hyphen, and the same for CMS, RN, etc.</li>
<li><tt>$CM-</tt> for tokens of type CM (as in the classification above)
that end with a hyphen, and the same for CMS, RN, etc.</li>
<li><tt>$-(-</tt> for tokens that contain an open bracket but not a close
bracket, such as "poly(ethylene" in "poly(ethylene oxide)"</li>
