<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Oscar 3 is a tool/set of tools for the annotation of chemical names and other 
entities in chemical text. Oscar3 can be run from the command line, to process
papers singly or in batch; it can also be run as a local web server, providing
a set of services via a web interface. The server runs on your computer, and
by default cannot be accessed from anywhere else. During the setup of Oscar3 
a workspace may be produced, which contains things such as documents that have
been processed by Oscar3, indices produced by the Oscar3 search engine, and
an extensible dictionary of chemical names.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Please see the included README file.</p>
<h2>Running</h2>
<p>Run the command <tt>java -Xmx512m -jar oscar3-a5.jar</tt>. Running this 
without arguments will display a list of options - please read these for more 
details. In particular, <tt>java -Xmx512m -jar oscar3-a5.jar</tt> will 
start the Oscar3 server. This can then be accessed on 
<a href="http://localhost:8181">http://localhost:8181</a>,
and is secured by default to only be accessible from the host it is running on.
Further details on processing documents with Oscar3 can be found
<a href="processing.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Source Texts</h2>
<p>Oscar3 can be fed texts in a number of forms, from a variety of sources. 
It works on texts in SciXML, and has (rudimentary) routines for automatically 
converting plain text and HTML to SciXML. These can be fed to Oscar3 <i>via</i> 
a number of routes. Importantly, some methods will import documents into your
workspace. These are kept in a subdirectory called <tt>corpora</tt>, with
a hierarchy of subsubdirectories, subsubsubdirectories etc. below that.
Each document in your workspace gets its own directory within one of these
(sub)subdirectories, and the SciXML that Oscar3 works on is kept in
a file called <tt>source.xml</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Oscar3 produces output in three main forms (a few experimental
forms also exist: inline annotation, standoff annotation, and 
inline annotation of experimental data ("data annotation"). 
In inline annotation (including data annotation), extra tags are added to the 
SciXML document, highlighting the entities recognised. 
an XML document is prepared, that is a list of all of the entities found 
and where they occurred in the source
document.</p>
<p>When Oscar3 is run on documents kept in your workspace, additional files
are added to the directories that the <tt>source.xml</tt> files are kept in.
SAF XML is kept in a file called <tt>saf.xml</tt>, inline annotation in a
file called <tt>markedup.xml</tt> and data annotation in a file called
<tt>data.xml</tt>.</p>
<h2>Using the workspace</h2>
<p>Having imported some documents into your workspace, and processed them,
you can then explore the documents you have processed. On the main server page,
follow the link "View Papers" to do this. You can also set up a search engine.
Follow the link "Select corpus for search" to create an index for a set of
papers. Once this index has been created, you can search it by following the
link "Search". Be sure to read the <a href="search.html">seach documentation</a>
to discover how to make use of the advanced searches that the search engine
can do.</p>
<h2>Customising</h2>
<p>Different styles of chemical text have different properties, and different
users have different needs. Because of this, Oscar3 is highly configurable.
Tuning of basic parameters can be done via a 
<a href="properties.html">properties file</a>, and large amounts of the 
<a href="data.html">data</a> that Oscar3 uses is modifiable. In particular,
you should familiarise yourself with the following items in the properties
file, as they can have a large effect on the performance of Oscar3 on
different types of texts.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>useMEMM</tt> - Oscar3 has two main methods for recognising chemical
names. This parameter sets which of these should be used.</li>
<li><tt>model</tt> - Oscar3 uses data extracted from hand-annotated texts as
examples to learn from. This parameter sets which set of data should be used.</li>
<li><tt>neThreshold</tt> - when <tt>useMEMM</tt> is set to <tt>yes</tt>, this
parameter can be used to tune Oscar3 to high precision (few false positives) or
high recall (few false negatives) - or a good balance of both.</li>
</ul>
