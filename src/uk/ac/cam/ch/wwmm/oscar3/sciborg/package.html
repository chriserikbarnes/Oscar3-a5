Experimental - works with papers parsed by RASP and PET.
<p>Usage. You will need to set safdbuser and safdbpasswd in the Oscar3
properties file, to point to a PostgreSQL database containing a database
called "saf" containing the results of a Sciborg run. You will also need
to create a database, called "papers", with a UTF8 encoding. To populate the
database, run the main method of ResultsDbWriter, giving the path of the
directory containing the Oscar3-processed papers that you used in the generation
of the SAF database.</p>
