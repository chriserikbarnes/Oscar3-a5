<h1>Using Scrapbook</h1>
<p><b>NB</b> Scrapbook is known to work with Firefox 1.5 and 2.0. It hasn't been extensively tested with anything else, although
some effort has been made to get it to work (a bit flakily) with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>There are two modes for using scrapbook - either you can annotate a whole paper, or use it to
collect and annotate example sentences. All of the annotations are kept in the folder you specified
on installation, so you can look at them by hand / feed them to scripts / whatever. This is kept in
sync with what you can see - there's no need to 'save'.</p>

<h3>Collecting examples</h3>
<p><b>1)</b> Go to the Scrapbook index and make a new Scrapbook.</p>
<p><b>2)</b> Look at the navigation bar under the title of the page you just looked at - this contains
several links. Drag the rightmost link to your bookmarks folder/toolbar/whatever. This is a bookmarklet that
contains a bit of Javascript that you'll need.
<p><b>3)</b> Go looking through some papers that have been rendered using my stylesheet. When you see something
interesting, highlight it in your browser. Then click on the bookmarklet. This should add it to your file.
<p><b>4)</b> Go back to the ScrapBook Index, select your
scrapbook, and you'll now see the various snippets you've collected - just the SciXML, no annotations. </p>
<p><b>5)</b> Click the 'edit' button on a snippet. This will bring up an editor. You can delete NE annotations or
edit attributes on the annotations using the buttons provided. You can also make new annotations by selecting
a bit of the text, and clicking on one of the buttons ("compound", "group" etc.) at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><b>6)</b> You can adjust the boundaries of an annotation by clicking it's "edit" button, as if to
edit its attributes.</p>
<p><b>7)</b> 'Regression Test' will compare the annotations that are in your scrapbook with a set of
annotations made by re-parsing contents of the scrapbook.</p>
<p><b>8)</b> 'Edit Types' provides a quick way of adjusting all of the named entity types
in a scrapbook.</p>
<p><b>9)</b> 'Edit Subtypes' provides a quick way of adjusting all of the
<a href="subtypes.html">named entity subtypes</a> in a scrapbook.</p>
<p><b>10)</b> 'Boolean Attributes' will prompt you for an attribute name. Given an attribute name
it will put a checkbox next to each named entity. The checkbox controls whether the attribute
is present (and gives it a value of "yes") or absent.</p>
<p><b>11)</b> You can get Oscar to annotate the paper using 'Auto Annotate', and remove all of the annotations
using 'Clear Annotations'.</p>

<h3>On whole papers</h3>
<p><b>1)</b> Go to the Add Paper To ScrapBook page,
select a paper in SciXML to read and give it a name. Alternatively, find a paper using 'View Papers' from 
the server's main menu, and click on one of the 'Add to Scrapbook' links.</p>
<p><b>2)</b> Go to the Scrapbook index and
select the paper you've just imported. You'll see the paper as a of annotated snippets.</p>
<p><b>3)</b> Edit the annotated snippets as above.</p>
<p><b>4)</b> Clicking 'SciXML paper' will reconstruct the paper as SciXML. This will also put files 
<code>markedup.xml</code> and <code>saf.xml</code> in the relevant scrapbook subdirectory.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Why aren't the annotations appearing when I click the buttons at the top of the screen?</dt>
<dd>Try configuring the pop-up blocker on your web browser not to block pop-ups from the server. Although
it doesn't look like ScrapBook is producing pop-ups, it works by creating pop-ups that close
themselves as a way of sending messages to the server. At some point this will have to be
replaced by an XMLHttpRequest.</dd>
