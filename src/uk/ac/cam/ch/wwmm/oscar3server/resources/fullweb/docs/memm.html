<h1>The MEMM</h1>
<p>This document details <a href="namerec.html">name recognition</a> using the
MEMM (Maximum Entropy Markov Model). Whether or not to use the MEMM is set by
the <tt>useMEMM</tt> option in the 
<a href="properties.html">properties file</a>. There are additional options
that may be configured as detailed below.</p>
<p>This file covers the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>The rescorer</li>
<li>CPR, ONT and CUST</li>
<li>Output from the MEMM</li>
<li>Configuring the MEMM</li>
</ol>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The MEMM provides a means for detecting named entities of types CM, RN,
CJ and ASE. A variety of ways of looking at chemical text, and guessing whether
spans of text represent chemical named entities or not, are combined into a
single machine-learning framework. In order to use the MEMM, data must be
extracted from hand annotated texts (the "training data")
and placed in <a href="data.html">model files</a> - two of these are included
in the Oscar3 distribution. Your choice of which model file to use is
set by the <tt>model</tt> option in the <a href="properties.html">properties
file</a>.
Additionally, the MEMM makes use of various
dictionaries and wordlists, such as the ChemNameDict.</p>
<p>Crucially, the MEMM is able to make
estimates of the probability of its guesses being correct, giving
a confidence score in the range of zero to one for each named entity it finds. 
For example, the word "1,3-dihydroxybenzene" is very obviously a chemical
name, and so the confidence score is likely to be high - above 0.9. Atypical
trivial names, such as "tacrolimus", are likely to get lower confidence
scores, especially if they do not appear in the built-in dictionaries and
did not occur in the training data. Similarly, words that look like chemical
names (for example "trimester", and many names of proteins) are likely to
get moderately high confidence scores, whereas words that look more like
plain English words - if they get confidence scores at all - are likely to
get very low confidence scores.</p>
<p>These confidence scores provide a unified way of tuning the balance
between precision and recall. A single value in the properties file - 
<tt>neThreshold</tt> - sets the minimum confidence score for entities to be
found. Setting this high (for example, around 0.5) results in high
precision at fair recall. A value of around 0.2 gives roughly balanced
precision and recall, and a value closer to 0.02 gives high recall at the
expense of precision.</p>
<p>These confidence scores depend not only on the words themselves, but on
the words (or numbers, or punctuation characters) to the left or right. For
example, compare "We studied tacrolimus." with 
"We studied tacrolimus concentrations.". In the latter example, the word
"concentrations" is a hint that the previous word might be a chemical name,
and so the confidence score in the latter example will be higher than in the
former.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MEMM is able to make multiple guesses about a single name.
For example, the word "carboxylates" could refer to a class
of chemical compounds, as in "benzoates are carboxylates", and thus give a 
named entity of class CM. Alternatively, it could be a verb, as in "The new
reagent carboxylates toluene", and thus be of class RN. The MEMM can make
guesses at both meanings, and record both guesses, along with confidence scores.
A similar situation exists for multi-word names. For example, given
"methyl orange", the system could guess (correctly) that "methyl orange" is
a chemical name, or it could just say that "methyl" is a single named 
entity.</p>
<h2>The rescorer</h2>
<p>Having detected named entities, there is then a process of rescoring
that adjusts the confidence scores generated in the previous step. This
process can be disabled by setting <tt>rescoreMEMM=no</tt> in the properties
file.</p>
<p>The rescoring process allows information to be shared throughout the
whole document. For example, consider "We studied tacrolimus. Later, we studied
tacrolimus concentrations.". As previously discussed, the word "concentrations"
is a clue that "tacrolimus" is a chemical name. In the rescoring phase, the
increased confidence for the latter "tacrolimus" is noted, and used to boost
the confidence of the first tacrolimus. This is especially important with
acronyms and abbreviations. For example, having "linoleic acid (LA)" in a text
will boost the confidence score of all incidences of LA in the document, as
they all probably stand for "linoleic acid", whereas having 
"local anesthetic (LA)" will have the reverse effect.</p>
<p>One problematic side effect of the rescoring procedure is that it destroys
some of the useful properties of the confidence scores extracted in the previous
step. Consider the example of "methyl orange". Before rescoring, the confidences
for "methyl" and "methyl orange" cannot add up to more that 1. After rescoring,
this is no longer true.</p>
<h2>CPR, ONT and CUST</h2>
<p>The MEMM does not provide a method for recognising these entities; these
are recognised using the old <a href="pattern.html">pattern-matching</a>
framework. Because of this, entities of type CPR, ONT and CUST never get
confidence scores.</p>
<h2>Output from the MEMM</h2>
<p>When using the MEMM, named entities of the appropriate types will gain
the attribute <tt>confidence</tt>, detailing the confidence score. A further
complication occurs in the case of overlapping entities. For example, in
the case of "methyl orange" versus "methyl", the confidence for one of these
will be higher. Unless the training data has included some instances of "methyl
orange" marked up as a single entity, the confidence for "methyl" will
probably (unfortunately, as it turns out) be higher - and thus
"methyl orange" will be <i>blocked</i>. Thus, in the SAF
XML, the following will be included in the entry for "methyl orange": 
<tt>&lt;slot name="blocked"&gt;true&lt;/slot&gt;</tt>. When the inline XML
is being made from the SAF XML, all entities that are blocked are not added
to the inline XML. This is done because otherwise, in the best case adding
blocked entities would make a mess of the inline XML, and in the worst case 
the inline XML would end up being ill-formed.</p>
<p>When entities of type CUST, ONT and CPR are involved, the situation
is further complicated, as these do not get confidence scores. However,
for the purpose of working out which entities block which other entities,
these are treated as having fixed confidences. So entities of type ONT will
be treated as having the confidence defined by <tt>ontProb</tt> in the
properties file, CUST as if they had the confidence defined by <tt>custProb</tt>
and CPR as if they had the confidence defined by <tt>cprProb</tt>.</p>
