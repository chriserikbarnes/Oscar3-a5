<h1>Extending Oscar3</h1>
<p>This file describes how to extend the capabilities of Oscar3, either
when using it as a standalone application, or as a library in a larger
application. All of these methods involve writing additional Java code; this
document assumes familiarity with things such as the classpath.</p>
<h2>Configuring Oscar3 properties without a properties file</h2>
<p>If, when using Oscar3 routines within your Java application, you want to use
different <a href="properties.html">properties</a>, but don't want to have an
external properties file, then you can set property values from within your
code. For example:</p>
<pre><tt>
		Properties props = new Properties();
		props.setProperty("neThreshold", "0.01");
		Oscar3Props.initialiseWithProperties(props);
		System.out.println(Oscar3Props.getInstance().neThreshold);
</pre></tt>
<h2>Overriding resource files from the classpath</h2>
<p>If you want to customise a <a href="data.htm">resource file</a>, using
data stored on the classpath, then use the following method. For example,
supposing you want to use a modified version of 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/neTerms.txt</tt>, and you
want to use the namespace <tt>ptc.tmp</tt>. I would create the
directory <tt>ptc/tmp/uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources</tt> on the
classpath, and place my modified version there. Then you should set
<tt>resourcePrefix=ptc/tmp/</tt> (note that there must be no leading slash,
and there must be a trailing one) as an Oscar3 property (probably using the
method described above).<p>
<p>Having set this property, whenever a ResourceGetter attempts to get a
resource from the classpath, it will first attempt to get it from the location
that includes the resource prefix, and if the resource is not found there,
it will look for it without the resource prefix. Thus, the resource prefix
allows you to over-ride the files you wish to over-ride, without needing
to modify the Oscar3 .jar file, or set up a workspace.</p>
<h2>Extending name resolution</h2>
<p>Oscar3 can be modified to use external resources for name resolution. For
example, it may be useful to send names to an external name-to-structure
converter, or to look them up in some external database. To do this, you need
to write a class that implements the interface
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.resolver.extension.ExtensionNameResolver</tt>. An
example implementation of this can be seen in
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.resolver.extension.ExampleResolver</tt>. The code
should be self-explanatory, even if the example is somewhat contrived.</p>
<p>Once you have an extension name resolver, you can activate it by setting
the <tt>extensionNameResolver</tt> property - for example, 
<tt>extensionNameResolver=uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.resolver.extension.ExampleResolver</tt>.
<p>With this property set, the following events take place whenever Oscar3
attempts to resolve a name:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oscar3 looks to see if the name is in its cache, and if so, uses the results
in the cache. If not:</li>
<li>Oscar3 looks up the name in a list of element names, and if it is present,
uses it. If not:</li>
<li>Oscar3 looks up the name in ChemNameDict, and if it is present, uses it. If
not:</li>
<li>Oscar3 looks up the name in a local <a href="newpubchem.html">PubChem
mirror</a> (if one has been set up), and if the name is present, it puts the
name, SMILES and InChI in its cache, and uses them. If not:</li>
<li>Oscar3 uses the extension name resolver. If the extension name resolver
gives a result, the result is placed in the cache, and use it. If not:</li>
<li>Oscar3 attempts to interpret the name using OPSIN. If this succeeds, it
places the result in the cache, and uses it. If not:</li>
<li>Oscar3 caches the fact that the name cannot be resolved.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not want to cache the results that are produced by the extension
name resolver, then set <tt>cacheExtensionNameResolver=no</tt>.</p>
<h2>Running routines at Oscar3 startup</h2>
<p>This section describes how to run custom code whilst using the main Oscar3
class. To do this, produce a class that implements the template 
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.misc.InitScript</tt> - for an example, see
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.misc.ExampleInitScript</tt>. Then, set the
<tt>initScript</tt> property - for example,
<tt>initScript=uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.misc.ExampleInitScript</tt>.</p>
<p>The main use for this is to modify the OscarFlow language, which is 
explained below.</p>
<h2>Modifying the OscarFlow language</h2>
<p>The <a href="flow.html">OscarFlow</a> system provides a way of running
several different processing tasks over documents. This system can be
extended in three different ways: by adding extra commands to the language,
adding extra information that can be carried through the system, and
adding additional output files.</p>
<p>To create extra commands, you need to implement the
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.flow.OscarFlow</tt> interface. For simple tasks,
this is best done by using a small anonymous inner class - and for larger tasks,
it may be useful to write a small anonymous inner class as a wrapper for the
class that does the real processing. An instance of this class should then
be fed to the FlowRunner singleton. 
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.misc.ExampleInitScript</tt> gives an example of
this. Once this is done, the OscarFlow language has been extended.</p>
<p>To carry additional information from one custom OscarFlow command to another,
use the <tt>getCustomDict()</tt> method of 
<tt>uk.ac.cam.ch.wwmm.oscar3.flow.OscarFlow</tt>. This gives you a 
<tt>Map&lt;String, Object>&gt;</tt> object, in which you can store data.</p>
<p>To produce custom output, use the <tt>customOutputStream(String name)</tt>
method - either directly, or via the <tt>customWriter(String name)</tt> or
<tt>customPrintWriter(String name)</tt> methods. This method gives you
an <tt>OutputStream</tt> (or <tt>Writer</tt> (writing UTF-8) or
<tt>PrintWriter</tt>, to which you can write information. You can then retrieve
that information using the <tt>customInputStream(String name)</tt> methods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, using these methods allows you to cause files to be written
to disk, or returned by the web server. When writing a directory full of
output files, Oscar3 will write an output file for each output stream you
requested - the filename will be the name of the stream. When you use the
Process servlet, try passing it an <tt>output</tt> parameter, corresponding
to the name of your custom output stream. If your stream name ends in
<tt>.xml</tt>, the data will be sent as <tt>application/xml</tt>, and if it
ends in <tt>.htm</tt> or <tt>.html</tt> it will be sent as <tt>text/html</tt>.
Otherwise, it will be sent as <tt>text/plain</tt>.</p>
