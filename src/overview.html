<html><head></head><body>Oscar3 (see the 
<a href="htdoc/index.html" target="_top">main documentation</a> for more details)
is a package for the recognition of
named entities (primarily chemical names) in chemical text. A number of
packages and classes here are described as "experimental" - these are not
essential to the main functioning of Oscar3, and may be poorly documented,
non-functional and/or buggy, and may safely be avoided by non-experts.</body></html>
