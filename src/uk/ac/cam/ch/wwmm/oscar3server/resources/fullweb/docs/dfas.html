<h1>Name Recognition DFAs</h1>
<p>This document describes the Discrete Finite Automata that are used to
recognise named entities. The role of these systems is described in the
<a href="namerec.html">name recognition help file</a>.</p>
<h2>Data files</h2>
<p>There are three data files for these modules: 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/neTerms.txt</tt>
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/custEnt.txt</tt>, and
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/ontology.txt</tt>. In addition,
multi-token entities from the ChemNameDict are also used. Of these,
<tt>neTerms.txt</tt> and the multi-token entities from the ChemNameDict are
only used when the MEMM is not in use, whereas <tt>ontology.txt</tt> and
<tt>custEnt.txt</tt> are used regardless of whether </p>
<p>The data files consist of a number of sections, denoted using headings
in square brackets, like <tt>[CM]</tt>. In <tt>neTerms.txt</tt> these
sections map onto what type the named entity is to be, whereas in 
<tt>ontology.txt</tt> these define which ontology identifier is to be used,
and in <tt>custEnt.txt</tt> these define the custType of the named entities
that are recognised.
Furthermore, there is a section called <tt>[DEFINE]</tt>, which allows
you to define macros that may be used in the rest of the file.</p>
<p>Further details of these files are given in the default <tt>neTerms.txt</tt>
file.</p>
