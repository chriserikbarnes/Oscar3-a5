<html><head></head><body>A dictionary of chemical names and structures.
<p>
This stores a list of names, each with a name ID, lists of SMILES and InChI strings,
which share chemical IDs, and a set of mappings between them. This means that several
names can refer to the same compound (eg THF, tetrahydrofuran), and one name can
refer to several compounds (eg THF could be tetrahydrofuran or tetrahydrofolate).
