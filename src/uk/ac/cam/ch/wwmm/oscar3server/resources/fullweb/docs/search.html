<h1>Oscar3 Search</h1>
<p>The Oscar3 server includes an advanced method for searching chemical
documents. This functionality is powered by 
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a>, and incorporates
additional components to enable chemically-aware and ontology-aware search
as well as standard keyword search.</p>
<h2>Getting ready to search</h2>
<p>You will first need to process some documents with Oscar3, and ensure
that they are stored in your workspace. This is best done using the 
<tt>ImportAndParse</tt> command from the command line, or by downloading
abstracts from PubMed via the web interface. You will then need to build an
index. On the main server page there is a link "Select corpus for search" -
click it, and then choose the directory containing the documents you want
to index. Oscar3 will analyse the documents and prepare an index. This index
will persist on disk even when the Oscar3 server is shut down.</p>
<h2>Searching</h2>
<p>You need to provide three pieces of information make a search - sensible
defaults are given for the latter two of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your search term(s)</li>
<li>Your query type - advanced (the default) or text only</li>
<li>The results format - snippets (the default), a HitsList or a CompoundsList</li>
</ol>
<h3>Simple text-only queries</h3>
<p>The simplest type of query is a text-only query, with the results as snippets.
Even this technique is very powerful, due to the power of Lucene's query parser.
Some example queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>alkaloids</tt> - find all documents containing the exact word "alkaloids"</li>
<li><tt>tropane alkaloids</tt> - find all documents that contain both the word 
"tropane" and the word "alkaloids".</li>
<li><tt>alkaloids tropane</tt> - exactly as above.</li>
<li><tt>"tropane alkaloids"</tt> - find all documents that contain the exact phrase
"tropane alkaloids".</li>
<li><tt>"tropane AND alkaloids"</tt> - as above.</li>
<li><tt>steroids OR alkaloids</tt> - find all documents that contain either "steroids",
"alkaloids" or both.</li>
<li><tt>steroids NOT alkaloids</tt> - find all documents that contain "steroids"
that do not contain "alkaloids".</li>
<li><tt>(new OR different) steroids</tt> - find all documents that both contain 
"steroids" and also either "new", "different" or both.</li>
<li><tt>"new steroids"~2</tt> - find all documents containing the words "new" and
"steroids" in close proximity to each other.</li>
<li><tt>"new steroids"~4</tt> - find all documents containing the words "new" and
"steroids" in close to moderate proximity to each other.</li>
<li><tt>steroid*</tt> - find terms starting in "steroid", for instance "steroid",
"steroids", "steroidal.</li>
<li><tt>?-hydroxylation</tt> - find terms like "3-hydroxylation" and
 "N-hydroxylation" but not "4'-hydroxylation" - that would need 
 <tt>??-hydroxylation</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>steroid~</tt> - find terms similar to "steroid", such as "steroids",
"nonsteroidal", "stearoyl" and "steric". Note that this is a similarity in
spelling and not necessarily in meaning.</li>
<li><tt>steroid~0.7</tt> - find terms very similar to "steroid".</li>
<li><tt>steroid~0.3</tt> - find terms with even a very slight similarity to 
"steroid".</li>
<li><tt>steroids^2 OR alkaloids</tt> - as <tt>steroids OR alkaloids</tt>, except
that documents containing "steroids" come higher up the list of results.</li>
<li><tt>steroids^0.5 OR alkaloids</tt> - as <tt>steroids OR alkaloids</tt>, except
that documents containing "steroids" come lower down the list of results.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice that the order in which the results are presented to you
represents the system's best guess as to how relevant each result is. This
relevance is calculated based on many factors. For example, when using
<tt>steroid~</tt>, documents containing "steroids" will in general 
be ranked higher than documents containing "steric".</p>
<h3>Advanced Queries</h3>
<p>Oscar3 adds in advanced queries, based on its knowledge of chemistry and
its ontologies. In advanced query mode, all of the above queries should
work as before - but finding some extra terms too. This is
best explained via some additional example queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>methylbenzene</tt> - methylbenzene is another word for toluene, so documents
containing "toluene" will also be found.</li>
<li><tt>InChI=1/C7H8/c1-7-5-3-2-4-6-7/h2-6H,1H3</tt> - this will also find
toluene.</li>
<li><tt>smiles:"c1ccccc1C"</tt> - yet another way to find toluene.</li>
<li><tt>smilessub:"c1ccccc1C"</tt> - finds toluene, and also compounds
with the toluene substructure such as propylbenzene and benzoic acid (NB:
the query system only understands simple substructure searches - it does
not understand SMARTS).</li>
<li><tt>smiles5like:"c1ccccc1C"</tt> - finds the five compounds in the
corpus (that Oscar3 was able to find) with the greatest similarity to toluene
 - probably including toluene itself.</li>
<li><tt>smiles10like:"c1ccccc1C"</tt> - as above, but gets ten compounds.</li>
<li><tt>"10 like toluene"</tt> - as above.</li>
<li><tt>alkaloids</tt> - finds all of the alkaloids that Oscar3 knows about,
via the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/">ChEBI</a> ontology that it 
contains.</li>
<li><tt>alkaloids OR steroids</tt> - find all documents containing at least
one compound that is either a steroid or an alkaloid (or both - for example, 
solanidine is both an alkaloid and a steroid!).</li> 
<li><tt>alkaloids^2 OR steroids</tt> - as above, but with documents
containing alkaloids being ranked higher than documents containing steroids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other combinations of features are possible - experiment with the system
to see what sort of queries work for you. Note that for multi-word chemical 
names, it is generally worth putting the
names in quotes. For example, <tt>"ethyl acetate"</tt> will get "EtOAc" as
well as "ethyl acetate", whereas <tt>ethyl acetate</tt> won't get "EtOAc", and
it will get "ethyl" on its own and "acetate" on its own (provided they occur
in the same document.</p>
<p>You should also note that all of this power comes with a high price: 
reliability. Not all of these queries will deliver comprehensive results.
Oscar3 cannot be expected to know about every single alkaloid in existence,
for example.</p>
<h2>Search Results</h2>
<p>There are three types of search result:</p>
<h3>snippets</h3>
<p>This is the default results format. You will see five hits per page - with
a link to the full document behind each hit, and relevant excepts with terms
highlighted. Note that only the terms that were found in your search are 
highlighted - if you see something obviously chemical like "benzene" which
isn't highlighted, you probably weren't searching for benzene, and if you
click through to the original document (on the blue title), you should
see "benzene" highlighted there.</p>
<h3>compoundsList</h3>
<p>This is something of a misnomer. This finds all named entities that were
in the documents you searched for - not just chemical compounds. 
For example, if you seach for steroids, this will list not only the steroids
that you found, but other compounds that co-occured in the documents: maybe
inhibitors of the enzymes that metabolise steroids, or maybe the nonsteroidal
precursors for steroid synthesis - or maybe they are other steroids
that the system did not know were steroids. Also listed is the number of times
each term appears in the corpus.</p>
<h3>hitsList</h3>
<p>This like like compoundsList, but it only lists the terms found by your
query. For example, in a search for steroids, the system will only find
compounds that it believes (rightly or wrongly) to be steroids. Other
nonsteroidal compounds - or other steroids that the system does not
know to be steroids - will not be listed.</p> 
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>It is possible (but rare) for the system to get into a state such that the entire
system is locked up, and not even restarting the server will cure the problem.
In which case, look in your workspace, and find the subdirectories <tt>index</tt>
and <tt>chemicalindex</tt>. It is likely that these have got into an invalid state.
Delete these and rebuilt your index from scratch.</p>
