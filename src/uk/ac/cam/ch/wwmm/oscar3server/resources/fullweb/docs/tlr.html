<h1>Token Level Regexes (TLRs)</h1>
<p>This module assists in the recognition of chemical named entities, when
the MEMM is not being used.</p>
<h2>TLR data data</h2>
<p>The data for the TLRs is kept in the resource file 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/recogniser/tlrs.xml</tt>. This file is an
XML file, with a similar structure to the 
<a href="dataparser.html">Data Parser's</a> data. Note that these regexes
are processed using Java's built-in regex capabilities and not JRegex, for
performance reasons. The file contains the following types of information:</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>tlrs</tt></dt>
<dd>Token Level Regexes: this element contains top-level definitions
of regular expressions with which to classify tokens (see the
<a href="namerec.html">name recognition documentation</a> for details). The 
<tt>tlr</tt> elements do not directly define the regexes: instead, they
incorporate them by reference.</dd>
<dt><tt>def</tt><dt>
<dd>These define regular expressions or parts of regular expressions, which
can be used by <tt>tlr</tt> elements, or be incorporated by reference into
<tt>regex</tt> sections of <tt>node</tt> elements, or into <tt>def</tt>
elements.</dd>
