<p>
The documentation for these is liable to be missing or inaccurate. Some of these
classes are experiments, some dead ends, some old bits of code that are being kept here in case I need
them again. There is no promise that any of these classes will do anything useful at all, and there
is nothing in the main source tree that depends on these.
