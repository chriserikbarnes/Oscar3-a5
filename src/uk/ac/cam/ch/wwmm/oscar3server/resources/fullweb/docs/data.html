<h1>Oscar3 data</h1>
<p>Oscar3 needs to use a considerable amount of data in order to analyse text.
This file explains the various sources of data that Oscar3 uses, and how
to manipulate those data sources.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>There are three main sorts of data used by Oscar3.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ChemNameDict</b> - a dictionary of chemical names and structures</li>
<li><b>Model files</b> - this is taken from documents that have
been marked up by hand</li>
<li><b>Resources Files</b> - these cover a wide range of files</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the properties file used for configuring Oscar3 also has an affect
on the operation of Oscar3</p>
<h3>ChemNameDict</h3>
<p>ChemNameDict is a store of chemical names and structures, that may be edited
by the user. In addition, ChemNameDict contains a mapping between chemical
structures and ontology identifiers, and a list of stop words.</p>
<p>The data for ChemNameDict is kept in the Oscar3 workspace, in the 
<tt>chemnamedict</tt> subdirectory, in a file called <tt>chemnamedict.xml</tt>.
If Oscar3 is being used without a workspace, then a version of the file held as
a resource file is used.</p>
<p>The format of ChemNameDict has been modified for Oscar3 Alpha 5. Alpha 4
and previous versions used a different format.</p>
<p>ChemNameDict consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of stopwords - words that are not chemical names</li>
<li>A list of chemical records - these must contain an InChI string, and may
also have names, ontology identifiers, and a SMILES string. The InChI string
for each chemical record is unique.</li>
<li>A list of orphan names - these are chemical names, without structures
or ontology identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this arrangement does not directly allow names to be associated
with ontology IDs without having an InChI string. If you need to do this,
list the chemical names in this file, and then list the mappings from
name to ontology identifier in 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/ontology.txt</tt> - this
arrangement will keep the name-to-ontology mappings, but also ensure
that the chemicals appear as named entities of type CM, and not ONT.</p>
<p>The default contents of ChemNameDict consist of a small set of common solvents
and regents (known by formulae or acronyms) compiled by the Oscar authors, a
larger set of names and structures and ontology identifiers (extracted from
ChEBI), and no stopwords or orphan names.</p>
<p>ChemNameDict can be modified via the ChemNameDict form, accessible via the
main server page. There, you can add compounds or stopwords, and also fetch
and import the latest version of ChEBI. Note that changes made here (except for
importing ChEBI) need to be saved to disc, using the button on the ChemNameDict
form.</p>
<p>Note that not all of the changes made to ChemNameDict will take effect
immediately; multi-word names that Oscar3 previously did not recognise will
not be immediately recognised, and the n-Gram-based algorithms that guess
whether words are chemical names or not will not will not immediately use the
new data you have added to the ChemNameDict. These changes can be made to
take effect by reloading all of the modules (from the main server page) or
by stopping the server (remember to save the ChemNameDict) and restarting
it.</p>
<h3>Model Files</h3>
<p>A good way to prepare data for Oscar3 is to mark up papers by hand, to
produce an annotation similar to what Oscar3 would have produced if it were
perfect. This data can then be analysed to make lists of chemical names,
non-chemical names and other such lists that can be used in document analysis.
Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the hand-annotated files is
used to generate parameters for a Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM), and also
for the maximum entropy models used for <a href="subtypes.html">subtype 
classification</a>.
However, these model files are essential even when the old patterns-based
name recognition is used instead of the MEMM.</p>
<p>These collections of data are kept as XML files, in two places: as resource
files, and as files in the Oscar3 workspace, in the <tt>models</tt>
subdirectory (this does not exist by default, but is
created when you compile a model file as described below). 
As different types of text have different characteristics,
the system allows multiple model files to be stored. Two are included
as default: <tt>chempapers</tt> (made from chemistry papers - the default) 
and <tt>pubmed</tt> (made from PubMed abstracts).</p>
<p>Additional models can be made by producing hand-annotated papers/abstracts
using the ScrapBook tool. Having produced these hand-annotated papers,
you can prepare new model files in two ways. The first is to run
Oscar3 with the command line option <tt>MakeModel</tt>, and the second is to
use the appropriate button on the ScrapBook main page. For each option
you will need to give your new model a name. These new models will be
placed in the <tt>models</tt> subdirectory in your workspace. In general
it is not a good idea to attempt to modify model files by hand.</p>
<p>Your choice of which model file to use can be set via the <tt>model</tt>
option in the <a href="properties.html">properties file</a>.
<p>Each model file contains, among other things, a set of word lists,
contained within the <tt>etd</tt> element of the model file.</p>
<h3>Resources Files</h3>
<p>These contain miscellaneous pieces of information that don't fit in anywhere
else. By default, these are "built into" Oscar3 - these are kept in the 
<tt>.jar</tt> file, or the directories that contain the Java classes. However,
it is possible to over-ride these files, by creating files in the Oscar3
workspace.<p>
<p>Overriding resource files is done in a hierarchy of subdirectories, 
found in the
<tt>resources</tt> subdirectory in the workspace. This subdirectory
should be considered as a partial mirror of the Oscar3 source tree. If a file
is present in the <tt>resources</tt> directory hierarchy, in the same 
subsubsub(etc.)directory as a resource file in the Oscar3 source, Oscar3 will
use the file in the <tt>resources</tt> subdirectory instead of the default.</p>
<p>The resource files can be explored using the "View Oscar3 resources" link
on the main server page. In addition, you can send update the resource
files online by sending a new version of the file via HTTP PUT to the same
URL that you view the resource file at. Note that changes will not necessarily
take effect immediately; you may need to reload the parts of Oscar3, for
example by using the "Reload all modules" link on the main server page.</p>
<p>Key resource files include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/dataparse/resources/regexes.xml</b> - this file
defines regular expressions used to parse experimental data sections.</li>
<li><b>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/recogniser/resources/tlrs.xml</b> - this file
defines regular expressions, used in the recognition of chemical formulae (and
a few other similar things). This is only used when not using the MEMM.</li>
<li><b>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/neTerms.txt</b> - a set

same style as neTerms.txt.</li>
<li><b>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/terms/resources/custEnt.txt</b> - a set
of custom named entities to recognise, in the style of neTerms.txt. 
By default no custom entities are recognised - some examples have
been provided in the comments in the file.</li>

list of common reagents, solvents and other chemicals to be included by
default in ChemNameDict.</li>

<li><b>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/misc/resources/*.xsl</b> (except typesToSciXML) 
- XSLT stylesheets that can be used to post-process inline annotation. See the
<tt>xsl</tt> command in <a href="flow.html">the OscarFlow</a> reference.</li>
<li><b>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/ptclib/cdk/resource/*.cml</b> templates for the
2D rendering module. You will also need to update extraTemplates.txt in the
same directory to make use of additional template that you put in that
directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other resource files also exist: these are often experimental
in purpose</p>
