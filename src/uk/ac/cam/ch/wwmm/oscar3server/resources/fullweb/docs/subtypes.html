<h1>Named Entity Subtypes</h1>
<p>When a chemical name is encountered in text, it is not always the case that
that name is being used to refer to a single, whole, well-specified chemical
compound. It is also possible for names to refer to classes of compounds, parts
of compounds, or other things beside. Similar problems are encountered with
reaction words, and other named entities detected by Oscar3.</p>
<p>It is usually possible to distinguish between the different named entity
types (<tt>CM</tt>, <tt>RN</tt>, <tt>CJ</tt>, <tt>ASE</tt> and <tt>CPR</tt>) on
the basis of name-internal features, and so the <a href="namerec.html">name
recognition</a> techniques used by Oscar3, which rely heavily on name-internal
features, do well at this. However, with these subtype divisions it is often
necessary to resort to name-external features, as the same word can commonly
be used in different ways. For example, in "a bottle of pyridine", "the newly
isolated compound was found to be a pyridine" and "a pyridine covalently linked
to a naphthalene core", the word <i>pyridine</i> is used in three different
senses, which can only be disambiguated by referring to context - to
name-external features.</p>
<p>The theory behind named entity subtypes is further explained in:</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In Oscar3, a named entity may have one subtype, represented as an attribute
(or slot) in the annotation. Subtypes are not always present; however, typically
either all of the non-<tt>ONT</tt> named entities in a document will have
subtypes, or none of them will.<p>
<h3>Manual Annotation</h3>
<p>Subtypes may be manually annotated within 
<a href="scrapbook.html">ScrapBook</a>. There is a mode of operation that allows
you to assign a subtype to each named entity. The set of available subtypes for
each named entity type is listed in the <a href="data.html">resource file</a>
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/misc/resources/neTypes.xml</tt> - this may be
edited if you wish to define additional subtypes. Once papers have been manually
annotated with subtypes, the process that generates model files will include
a subtypes model within the model file.</p>
<h3>Automatic Annotation</h3>
<p>The automatic annotation is performed using the <tt>subtypes</tt> task in
<a href="flow.html">OscarFlow</a> - this is not performed by default. This task
uses a maximum entropy classifier and a simple feature set to make its choices;
more details are given in Corbett, Batchelor and Copestake 2008. There are two
important implementation details here.</p>
<p>First, the sets of subtypes that are recognised are determined by the model
file used. If a model file is trained with a non-standard set of subtypes, then
when that model is used, those subtypes will be recognised. The subtypes task
does not refer to <tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/misc/resources/neTypes.xml</tt>
during processing.</p>
<p>Secondly, the subtypes classifier makes probablistic decisions. When it
encounters a named entity with a confidence score, it can transform that named
entity into a set of named entities with different subtypes and confidence
scores. For example, consider a named entity with type <tt>CM</tt> and
confidence 0.8. Suppose the subtypes classifier thinks that the entity has a
0.75 probability of having subtype <tt>EXACT</tt> and a 0.25 probability of
having subtype <tt>CLASS</tt>. The subtypes task will take the original 
subtypeless named entity, and convert it into two named entities: one of
subtype <tt>EXACT</tt> and confidence 0.6 (0.8 * 0.75), and one of subtype
<tt>CLASS</tt> and confidence 0.2 (0.8 * 0.25). The most probable subtype will
always be reported, even if the new confidence score goes below the value of
<tt>neThreshold</tt> set in the <a href="properties.html">properties file</a>.
For the less probable subtypes, the subtypes will be reported if the confidence
is above the threshold, and dropped if below.</p>
