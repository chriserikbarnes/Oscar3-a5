<h1>New PubChem Mirror for Oscar3</h1>
<p>This file explains the (new as of alpha5) method of storing PubChem records,
to assist with name resolution. Rather than using SQL bases, this new method
uses simple on-disk data structures to store the data.</p>
<h2>Initialisation</h2>
<p>First, make sure you have set up a workspace for Oscar3. Next, run Oscar3
from the command line with the <tt>FetchPubChem</tt> command. And wait for
a few hours, while Oscar3 downloads the relevant files from PubChem (several
gigabytes of them - it may be a good idea to inform your systems administrator
or other users of your network connection before doing this), analyses
them, and builds an index. And that's it! No further action is required.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can fetch the relevant files from PubChem yourself. You
will need all of the <tt>.sdf.gz</tt> files in 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/CURRENT-Full/SDF</a>, and
also the files <tt>CID-MeSH</tt> and <tt>CID-Synonym.gz</tt> from
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Compound/Extras</a>.
These should be placed in the directory specified by the <tt>pcdir</tt>
property in the Oscar3 properties file. If this has not already been set,
or has been set to <tt>none</tt>, you will need to set it yourself. Having
fetched the relevant files, run Oscar3 with the <tt>BuildPubChem</tt>
command.</p>
