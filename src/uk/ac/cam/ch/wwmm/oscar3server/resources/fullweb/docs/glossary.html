<h1>Oscar3 Glossary</h1>
Oscar3, by necessity, contains a lot of terminology from various sources. This
terminology is listed here.
<dl>
<dt>SMILES</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.daylight.com/smiles/">Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System</a>:
a simple string that represents a chemical compound. Eg. CC(=O)C for acetone.</dd>

<dt>InChI</dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.iupac.org/inchi/">IUPAC International Chemical Identifier</a>:
another way of representing a chemical compound with a string. These are better for use
as unique identifiers than SMILES, but not as easy to write by hand.</dd>

<dt>SciXML</dt>
<dd>An XML format for scientific papers and related documents, developed at the
Computer Laboratory in Cambridge. Note that this does not include the annotations
that Oscar3 produces, nor the additional bits of markup produced by some parts of
the Oscar3 server. Oscar3, does, however, contain rudimentary facilities for converting
plain text or HTML into SciXML. For further details, see:<br>
CJ Rupp, Ann Copestake, Simone Teufel and Ben Waldron.<br>
<a href="http://www.allhands.org.uk/2006/proceedings/papers/678.pdf">Flexible Interfaces in the Application of Language Technology to an eScience Corpus.</a><br>
Proceedings of the UK e-Science Programme All Hands Meeting 2006 (AHM2006), Nottingham, UK.</dd>

<dt>Publisher's XML, PubXML</dt>
<dd>A generic term for the XML schemas used by publishers (RSC, NPG etc.) for their papers.
You need an XSLT stylesheet to transform these into SciXML.</dd>

<dt>Round Trip</dt>
<dd>To take a Publisher's XML document, convert it to SciXML, to process the SciXML, and then
to take the annotations on the SciXML and transfer them back to the PubXML.</dd>

<dt>SciBorg</dt>
<dd>A four-year project for the development of natural language processing methodologies,
and their application to chemistry texts, running in Cambridge.</dd>

<dt>OPSIN</dt>
<dd>Open Parser for Systematic IUPAC Nomenclature. This converts systematic chemical names
to structures. As well as being a part of Oscar it can function on its own as a Java library.</dd>

<dt>OSCAR</dt>
<dd>Open Source Chemistry Analysis Routines</dd>

<dt><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a></dt>
<dd>A Java library for building search engines, developed by the
Apache Software Foundation. The <a href="search.html">Oscar3 search system</a>
makes extensive use of Lucene.</dd>

<dt>CDK</dt>
<dd>The <a href="http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdk/">Chemistry Development Kit</a>,
a Java library for chemistry hosted by Christoph Steinbeck's group at the Cologne University Bioinformatics Center.</dd

<dt>CML</dt>
<dd>Chemical Markup Language, a schema for chemical data developed by Peter Murray-Rust and
his group.</dd>

<dt>Standoff annotation</dt>
<dd>A form of annotation where the original document is kept unchanged, and an annotation
document is prepared which contains references to the original.</dd>

<dt>SAF</dt>
<dd>A format for storing standoff annotation of SciXML documents.</dd>

<dt>Inline annotation</dt>
<dd>The opposite of standoff annotation, this is where additional information is inserted
into the document that is being annotated.</dd>

<dt>Inline data annotation</dt>
<dd>Inline annotation containing a detailed markup of experimental data
sections, for example NMR spectra, melting points and other routine methods
of characterising newly synthesised organic compounds.</dd>

<dt>Named Entity, NE</dt>
<dd>An item in text with a name. The term "named entity" is usually used in natural language
processing to refer to things like places, people, organisations etc. In Oscar3 the term
is used to refer to things like chemical compounds.</dd>

<dt>Subtype</dt>
<dd>A subclassification of a named entity: see <a href="subtypes.html">here</a>
for more.</dd>

<dt>Name Recognition</dt>
<dd>The stage of processing where named entities are spotted. See 
<a href="namerec.html">the name recognition help file</a> for how this is 
done.</dd>

<dt>Name Resolution</dt>
<dd>The stage where chemical structures are added to the named entities that
were recognised in the name recognition stage.</dd>

<dt>XPoint</dt>
<dd>Something that looks like <tt>/1/2/4/1/6.23</tt>. This points towards a specific
position in an XML document.</dd>

<dt>ScrapBook</dt>
<dd>A part of the Oscar server that performs two overlapping tasks: collecting interesting
"snippets" (phrases, sentences, paragraphs) from SciXML documents, and editing inline
annotations on SciXML.</dd>

<dt>CompoundsList</dt>
<dd>A list of chemicals (or things that Oscar believes to be chemicals) found in a set
of papers found using the search engine</dd>

<dt>Bookmarklet</dt>
<dd>A Link containing Javascript - you add it to your bookmarks/favourites, and click
on it when you want to use it. These provide the simplest way to extend the functionality
of web browsers. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklets">this Wikipedia entry</a>
for more details.</dd>

<dt>OscarFlow</dt>
<dd>A small command language for running Oscar modules over text. See <a href="flow.html">the
OscarFlow documentation</a> for more details.</dd>

<dt>Case Normalisation</dt>
<dd>Case normalisation consists of looking at each token in a string, and if
it contains two lowercase letters in a row, converting the entire token to
lowercase.</dd>

<dt>ChemNameDict</dt>
<dd>This is a dictionary of chemical names and structures, most
useful for recognising and resolving the trivial names in papers. Previously known
as 'HandBag'. See <a href="data.html">the Oscar3 data model</a> for more details.</dd>

<dt>Extracted training data</dt>
<dd>This is data extracted from hand-annotated texts, used in named-entity 
recognition. See <a href="data.html">the Oscar3 data model</a> for more details.</dd>

<dt>Resource file</dt>
<dd>See <a href="data.html">the Oscar3 data model</a> for details.</dd>

<dt>n-gram based classifier</dt>
<dd>A module that classifies words into chemical and non-chemical, by
dividing them up into 4-character fragments. See <a href="ngram.txt">the
help file</a> for more details.</dd>

<dt>Data Parser</dt>
<dd>A module that recognises experimental data (such as NMR spectra). 
See <a href="dataparser.html">the help file</a>
for more details.</dd>

<dt>DFA Name recogniser</dt>
<dd>A module that is responsible for the overall recognition of potential named
entities, that works by recognising a sequence of one or more token
classifications. See <a href="dfas.html">the help file</a>
for more details.</dd>

<dt>Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM)</dt>
<dd>The new method for recognising named entities: see <a href="memm.html">the
MEMM documentation</a> for examples.</dd>

<dt>Subtype</dt>
<dd>Currently experimental: a subclassification of named entities. For example,
CMs may be classified into exact compounds, classes of compounds, parts of
compounds and a number of other subtypes.</dd>

<dt>Stopword</dt>
<dd>In Oscar3, a word that the name recogniser should not recognise as a
chemical name, or other named entity (except for ONT).</dd>
