<h1>The Data Parser</h1>
<p>This modules performs the task of recognising and parsing experimental data
such as NMR and IR spectra, melting points, elemental analysis and other
routine methods of characterising newly synthesised organic compounds. 
It requires a data file that works by defining regular expressions. These 
regular expressions are defined using the 
<a href="http://jregex.sourceforge.net/">JRegex</a> regular
expression language, and not the built-in Java regular expression
language, for historical reasons.</p>
<p>The process of data parsing is triggered in a number of different ways. See
the <a href="processing.html">Processing</a> and <a href="flow.html">OscarFlow</a>
documentation for more details. The output of data parsing is a document in
itself, known as "Inline Data XML", and in the modes which can generate
multiple output files for a given input, the output files are named "data.xml".</p>
<p>By default, the data parser only looks for data in sections of the document
with the heading "Experimental". To change this behaviour, you may set
the <a href="properties.html">property</a> <tt>dataOnlyInExperimental</tt> to
<tt>no</tt>, which will cause the parser to look for data in the entire document.</p>
<h2>Data Parser data</h2>
<p>The data for the Data Parser is kept in the resource file 
<tt>uk/ac/cam/ch/wwmm/oscar3/dataparse/regexes.xml</tt>. This file is an
XML file, and contains several types of information:</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>top</tt>, <tt>node</tt></dt>
<dd>These define a tree of regular expressions. The <tt>top</tt> element
is used for paragraphs in experimental sections. This element defines
a number of <tt>child</tt> elements. For each <tt>child</tt>, the <tt>node</tt>
corresponding to the <tt>child</tt> is found, and the regular expression
defined in the <tt>regex</tt> is run over the paragraph. If the regular
expression matches, then the span corresponding to the group defined in
the <tt>parsegroup</tt> attribute is wrapped up in an XML element, and the
<tt>node</tt> elements referenced in each <tt>child</tt> are run on that span,
and so on recursively.</dd>
<dt><tt>def</tt><dt>
<dd>These define regular expressions or parts of regular expressions, which
can be incorporated by reference into
<tt>regex</tt> sections of <tt>node</tt> elements, or into <tt>def</tt>
elements.</dd>
